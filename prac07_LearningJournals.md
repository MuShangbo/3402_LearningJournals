Setting Up Environment:
Started by setting up my development environment. Installed PHP and a simple code editor to begin writing PHP scripts.

Hello World:
Created my first PHP script to display "Hello World" on the browser. The process of running PHP scripts on a server was new but intriguing.

Variables and Echo:
Explored basic PHP variables and used the echo statement to output content. Understanding how variables work in PHP seems crucial for dynamic content.

Data Types:
Briefly touched upon different data types like strings, integers, and floats. PHP's loosely typed nature makes it flexible for various applications.

Simple Calculation:
Implemented a basic calculation using PHP. The ability to perform mathematical operations directly in PHP is convenient.

Conclusion:
Although it was a brief introduction, I feel like I've grasped the basic building blocks of PHP. The syntax appears intuitive, and I'm excited to explore more complex features in the days to come. Looking forward to building on this foundation and creating more dynamic web applications with PHP.
