WEEK_01_Learning Journals:_________MuShanbo

Week 1:
Through this week's study, I felt a lot of problems. There was something wrong with my web host account this week, and I have been constantly revising the problems in this respect. Under the guidance of the professor, I successfully completed the website. It took me about 5 hours to complete this week. The biggest problem is that my website picture can not be put on, repeated modification is still not possible. Finally, the problem was completed by consulting the information.
